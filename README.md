# Acoustic Emission (AE) Sound Measurement System

This project involves the acquisition, processing, and analysis of Acoustic Emission (AE) signals for sound-based monitoring and diagnostic applications. AE techniques are commonly used for detecting micro-cracks, leaks, material degradation, and structural changes through sound emissions.

Overview:
The system captures high-frequency acoustic signals generated by materials or structures under stress. These signals are then filtered, processed, and analyzed to identify patterns or anomalies.

Typical use cases:
    Structural health monitoring (SHM)
    Leak detection
    Material fatigue testing
    Non-destructive testing (NDT)
